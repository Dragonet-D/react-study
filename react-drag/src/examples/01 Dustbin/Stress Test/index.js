					This example is similar to the previous one, but props of both the
					drag sources and the drop targets change every second. It demonstrates
					that React DnD keeps track of the changing props, and if a component
					receives the new props, React DnD recalculates the drag and drop
					state. It also shows how a custom <code>isDragging</code>{' '}
					implementation can make the drag source appear as dragged, even if the
					component that initiated the drag has received new props.
